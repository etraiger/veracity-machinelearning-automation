# How to contribute to Veracity

I'm really glad you're reading this, since we encurage developers to contribute to all and any code we publish on github.

If you haven't already, visit our developers corner at [Veracity Developer](https:\\developer.veracity.com). We want you working on things you're excited about.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Veracity Developers Documentation](https://developer.veracity.com\docs) tells you where we are,
  * Bugs? [Issue tracker](https://github.com/veracity/veracity-machinelearning-automation/issues) is where to report them on github code.


## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Veracity](https://github.com/veracity/veracity-quickstart-samples/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, someone in our dev team will check out you code. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
